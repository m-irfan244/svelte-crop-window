# svelte-media-crop

A component for cropping images and videos that supports touch pinch, zoom, and rotate gestures, as well as mousewheel zoom, mouse-dragging the image, and rotating on right mouse button.

Currently looking for contributors to help bring this into a good shape so other people than just me can use it.

If you can do code-review, that's very welcome.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
